### About
I hold a Bacehlor's degree in Music Technology and a Certification in Multimedia design that included web design and development, graphic design, audio video production and 3d modeling, rendering and gaming.

I've been working as a front end developer since 2010, have some background in visual design and have a proven track record for details, reusability, and visual design.
Crafting easy to use interfaces with care, consistency, and simplicity for the end user is what excites me about front end development.

### Past Few Months
The past few months of work has included a good deal of accessibiliy updates and new feature development to the flagship site, some component library work for the 2021 election cycle, and self study of the Gatsby ecosystem in preparation for some tool migrations.

I've always enjoyed working with and on component libraries to see how best you can suit the needs of downstream authors. It supports consistency, reusability, helps to prevent drift in a codebase, and forces one to consider levels of abstraction. Pair this with solid documentation and libraries can serve to build numerous features to add to an application or website.

### Prior Highlights
I managed a React based component library that fed multiple downstream applications, maintained and shipped documentation alongside this library using Storybook.
I worked successfully with various business teams and marketing folk to translate their design mocks to functional and well crafted code in a Drupal environment and adapted existing scripted solutions for widgets to be used in a WYSIWYG fashion by business teams.

### Interests and Other Bits
Interests outside of development include
* Working on the house
* Playing board games with friends (have been an avid board gamer for years)
* Cooking or entertaining people at the house

Prior to development, I spent many years in food service both front and back of house, a la carte and catering, function coordination.
While that experience pre dated my time in development, it was an essential growth of character, soft skills, and learning to manage and work under controlled chaos which had prepared me greatly for work in software development and engineering.
